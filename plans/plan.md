# Engineering Implementation Plan - Multiverse Inference System

## 1. Feature Deconstruction

### Implementation Summary
Build a distributed AI inference gateway that enables students to share and access AI models hosted on their own servers through a unified OpenAI-compatible API. The system acts as a routing layer that manages model server registration, performs continuous health monitoring, and routes inference requests to healthy backend servers with automatic failover.

## 2. Technical Scope

### Affected Systems/Components
**New Systems (To Be Created)**:
- FastAPI application server (gateway)
- SQLite database for model registry
- Background health checker service
- Admin API endpoints (`/admin/*`)
- Inference API endpoints (`/v1/*`)
- Web UI routes and pages (`/`, `/dashboard`, `/register`, etc.)
- Request routing service
- Centralized logging system
- Configuration management system
- Frontend static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering

**External Systems (Dependencies)**:
- Student-hosted model servers (ngrok tunnels)
- OpenAI API specification (compatibility target)
- CDN-hosted frontend libraries (Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, etc.)

### Dependency Map

**Internal APIs**:
- Registry Service: CRUD operations on model_servers table
- Routing Service: Query healthy servers, select via round-robin
- Health Checker Service: Async background task updating server health status
- Validation Utils: URL validation, input sanitization

**External Services**:
- Student backend servers: OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions` endpoints
- Ngrok or similar tunneling services (student-provided)

**Libraries/SDKs**:

Backend (Python):
- `fastapi` - Web framework (required)
- `uvicorn[standard]` - ASGI server (required)
- `httpx` - Async HTTP client (required)
- `pydantic` - Data validation (required, included with FastAPI)
- `pydantic-settings` - Configuration management (recommended)
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable loading (recommended)
- `aiosqlite` - Async SQLite support (optional, or use raw sqlite3)
- `jinja2` - HTML templating (required for Web UI)

Frontend (JavaScript/CSS via CDN):
- Tailwind CSS - Responsive styling framework
- Alpine.js or vanilla JavaScript - Frontend interactivity
- Chart.js - Health history visualization (optional)
- Day.js - Date formatting (optional)

### Architectural Notes & Decisions

**Architecture Pattern**: Monolithic application with separation of concerns
- Single FastAPI application serving both API and Web UI
- Modular structure with routers, services, and utilities
- Background task for health checking (asyncio.create_task)
- Server-side rendering with Jinja2 templates
- Static file serving for CSS, JavaScript, and images

**Database Design**:
- SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent access
- Single `model_servers` table (primary)
- Optional `health_checks` table for historical tracking (Phase 6)
- Indexes on `model_name`, `health_status`, `is_active`

**Async Design**:
- FastAPI async endpoints for all request handlers
- `httpx.AsyncClient` for backend server communication
- `asyncio` background task for health checker
- No external task queue (Celery/RQ) - keep it simple

**API Compatibility**:
- Strict adherence to OpenAI API format for inference endpoints
- Custom admin endpoints for registration/management
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs auto-generated by FastAPI

**Load Balancing**:
- Phase 1-4: Simple round-robin (in-memory counter)
- Future: Could add latency-based or weighted algorithms

**Security Model**:
- API key authentication for admin endpoints (X-API-Key header)
- Optional API key for client inference endpoints
- URL validation to prevent SSRF attacks
- Input validation via Pydantic models

## 5. Resource & Timeline

### Roles Required
- **Backend Developer(s)**: Python/FastAPI expertise, async programming knowledge
- **Frontend Developer(s)**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, responsive design, UI/UX principles
- **DevOps/Deployment**: Optional for production deployment assistance
- **QA/Testing**: Manual testing with actual student servers and UI testing
- **Technical Writer**: Optional for documentation polish

### Estimated Timeline
**Note**: Timing removed per user request. Agents will execute phases sequentially.

### Potential Bottlenecks
- **Phase 2**: Initial health check may be slow if student servers are unresponsive
- **Phase 3**: OpenAI API compatibility requires careful attention to response format details
- **Phase 4**: Async background task coordination with database updates needs careful design
- **Phase 5**: Streaming proxy may have edge cases with different backend implementations
- **Phase 6**: Web UI implementation with multiple views and real-time features may require iteration
- **Phase 7**: Documentation quality depends on thoroughness, can be time-intensive

---

## 6. Communication Plan

### Key Stakeholders
- **Instructor/Course Lead**: Final approval on deployment readiness
- **Students (Server Hosts)**: Need registration documentation and support
- **Students (Model Users)**: Need usage documentation and API examples
- **TAs/Support Staff**: Need troubleshooting guides

### Reporting Cadence & Method
- **Per Phase**: Create PR with implementation, link to requirements met
- **After Phase 2**: Demo registration API to instructor, recruit 3 test servers
- **After Phase 3**: Demo end-to-end inference to instructor and test users
- **After Phase 4**: Share health monitoring logs with instructor
- **After Phase 5**: Demo streaming to instructor
- **After Phase 6**: Demo Web UI to instructor and students, collect usability feedback
- **After Phase 7**: Final review and classroom rollout decision

### Status Updates
- Progress tracked via GitHub issues/PRs
- Devlog entries for significant decisions or blockers
- Demo videos or screenshots for each phase completion

---

## 7. Plan Summary

### Total Estimated Phases
**7 Phases**, each designed as a single pull request of medium complexity:
1. **Foundation**: Infrastructure, database, logging, config (M)
2. **Registration API**: Server registration and management (M)
3. **Inference Routing**: OpenAI-compatible endpoints with failover (M)
4. **Health Checker**: Background health monitoring (M)
5. **Streaming Support**: SSE streaming for real-time responses (M)
6. **Web User Interface**: Browser-based dashboard, forms, and testing interface (M)
7. **Polish & Docs**: Error handling, documentation, production readiness (M)

### Critical Path/Key Dependencies
- **Phase 1** â†’ **Phase 2** â†’ **Phase 3**: Foundation enables registration, which enables routing
- **Phase 2** + **Phase 3** â†’ **Phase 4**: Health checker needs servers registered and routing implemented
- **Phase 3** â†’ **Phase 5**: Streaming builds on non-streaming routing
- **Phase 2** + **Phase 3** + **Phase 4** â†’ **Phase 6**: Web UI needs API endpoints functional
- **All Phases** â†’ **Phase 7**: Polish phase depends on all features being implemented

**Alternative Sequencing** (Early UI Feedback):
If user feedback is critical, consider: Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 â†’ Phase 6 (basic UI) â†’ Phase 4 â†’ Phase 5 â†’ Phase 6 (complete) â†’ Phase 7. This delivers a working UI earlier for usability testing, though it may require rework.

**Alternative Sequencing** (Risk-First):
If student servers are known to be highly unstable, consider: Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 â†’ Phase 4 â†’ Phase 3 â†’ Phase 5 â†’ Phase 6 â†’ Phase 7. This builds health checking before routing, improving reliability from day one.

### Suggested First Step
1. Create virtual environment: `python3.11 -m venv env`
2. Activate: `source env/bin/activate`
3. Create `plans/plan.md` (this document) âœ…
4. Begin **Phase 1: Foundation** - Set up project structure and infrastructure
5. Create PR for Phase 1 when complete

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17  
**Next Review**: After Phase 3 completion
**Changelog**:
- v2.0: Added Phase 6 (Web User Interface) with comprehensive UI specifications
