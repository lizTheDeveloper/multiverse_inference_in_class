   - Resource limits (65536 file descriptors, 1GB memory)
   - Auto-restart on failure with 10-second delay
   - Journal logging with syslog identifier

6. **nginx.conf** (3KB)
   - Reverse proxy configuration
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirect
   - Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS setup
   - Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
   - Streaming support (disabled buffering)
   - Extended timeouts for long-running requests (600s)
   - Health check endpoint without logging

### Example Scripts (`examples/`)

1. **list_models.py** (1.9KB)
   - Lists all available models via `/v1/models` endpoint
   - Displays model metadata (owner, creation date)
   - User-friendly formatted output

2. **check_health.py** (5KB)
   - Comprehensive health monitoring
   - Gateway health check via `/health`
   - Server statistics via `/admin/stats` (requires API key)
   - Server health summary with percentages
   - Counts servers by health status (healthy/unhealthy/unknown)

## Verification

All deployment scripts are:
- Created and executable (`chmod +x`)
- Following security best practices
- Well-documented with comments
- Production-ready

All example scripts are:
- Tested and functional
- Include proper error handling
- User-friendly output formatting

## Deployment Scripts Usage

```bash
# Initial GCE setup (run as root)
sudo bash deploy/gce-setup.sh

# Install application
sudo bash deploy/install.sh

# Update application
sudo bash deploy/update.sh

# Backup database
bash deploy/backup.sh

# Manage service
sudo systemctl start multiverse-gateway
sudo systemctl status multiverse-gateway
sudo systemctl stop multiverse-gateway
```

## Security Features

1. **systemd service hardening:**
   - Non-root user execution
   - No new privileges
   - Private /tmp directory
   - Protected system directories
   - Read-write access only where needed

2. **nginx security headers:**
   - HSTS with 1-year max-age
   - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-XSS-Protection enabled

3. **TLS configuration:**
   - TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only
   - Strong cipher suites
   - Server cipher preference
   - Session caching
